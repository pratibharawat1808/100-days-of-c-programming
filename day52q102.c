//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int n,i,x,index=-1;
    printf("Enter array size: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int arr[n];
    printf("Enter sorted array elements: ");
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&arr[i]);}
    printf("Enter x: ");
    scanf("%d",&x);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]>=x){
            index=i;
            break;}}
    printf("Index of ceil = %d\n",index);
    return 0;
